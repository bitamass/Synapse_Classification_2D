# Results

This directory contains analysis outputs generated during training and evaluation:

- training and validation accuracy/loss curves
- confusion matrices
- ROC and precision–recall curves
- numerical metrics (JSON or CSV)
- experiment notes and logs

Model checkpoint files (e.g., `.pt`, `.pth`) are intentionally excluded via `.gitignore` to keep the repository lightweight.
